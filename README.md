If you're looking at this from the future, then I didn't get rejected in the Functional Programming subject :P.  
[Here's a website](https://www.tsouanas.org/teaching/fun/2024.2/) made by my teacher, with more information about homework, topics, etc.

### About
The "FUN" stands for "Functional". So here's my personal study stuff in Functional Programming at **UFRN**.  
I really don't expect that this will help anyone besides me, just for downloading my files to other devices.  
Well, ty if you're here for some reason anyway :)
