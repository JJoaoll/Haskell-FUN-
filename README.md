# Haskell-FUN-
I'ts a repository to save all my Functional Programming studies in Haskell

If u're looking at this from the future, then i didn't get rejected in the Functional Programming SUbject :P
[Here's a website](https://www.tsouanas.org/teaching/fun/2024.2/), made by my teacher, with more information about homeworks, topics and etc.

The "FUN" stands for "Functional". So here's my personal studies stuff in Functional Programming in UFRN.
I really don't spect that this will help someone besides me, downloading my files in another devices. 
Well, ty if u're here by some reason anyway :)
